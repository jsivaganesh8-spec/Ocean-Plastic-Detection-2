# Ocean Plastic Detection 2

A practical repository for detecting ocean plastic in images — built to help researchers, conservationists, and hobbyists find and classify plastic waste in coastal and marine photos. The goal is to make it easy to train or run a detection model, evaluate results, and contribute improvements.

Why this repo exists
- Ocean plastic is a growing global problem. Automated detection helps scale monitoring from photos and drone footage.
- This project provides a straightforward starting point for training, running, and evaluating object-detection models on ocean-plastic datasets.

About
This repo contains code, configuration, and utilities to train and evaluate object-detection models on images containing ocean plastic. It focuses on being approachable: clear defaults, easy-to-follow setup, and notes for scaling to larger datasets or GPU clusters.

Features
- Simple training and evaluation scripts
- Inference script for single images and folders
- Lightweight utilities for dataset preparation and visualization
- Config-driven model and hyperparameter settings so you can swap backbones or detectors easily

Quick start (local)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/jsivaganesh8-spec/Ocean-Plastic-Detection-2.git
   cd Ocean-Plastic-Detection-2

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Prepare data (see Dataset section below).

5. Train a model:
   python train.py --config configs/default.yaml

6. Run inference on an image:
   python infer.py --weights runs/exp/best.pt --image path/to/photo.jpg

Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Common libraries: numpy, pandas, opencv-python, torch (or tensorflow depending on implementation)
- See requirements.txt for complete list and exact versions

Dataset
This repository expects a detection-style dataset (images + bounding boxes + class labels). Typical layout:
- data/
  - images/
    - train/
    - val/
    - test/
  - annotations/
    - train_annotations.json
    - val_annotations.json

If you have a different format (e.g., VOC, COCO, CSV), use the dataset utilities in scripts/ to convert to the expected format. If you don't have labels yet, consider using manual annotation tools like LabelImg or MakeSense.ai and export to COCO or Pascal VOC.

Training
- Main entry: train.py
- Config: configs/default.yaml (model settings, optimizer, learning rate, augmentations, dataset paths)
- Example:
  python train.py --config configs/default.yaml --epochs 50 --batch-size 8

Tips:
- Start with a small subset to verify the pipeline works.
- Use pretrained backbones (if supported) to speed up convergence.
- Monitor validation metrics and save the best checkpoint.

Inference / Usage
- Single image:
  python infer.py --weights PATH_TO_WEIGHTS --image PATH_TO_IMAGE --output out.jpg
- Batch inference:
  python infer.py --weights PATH_TO_WEIGHTS --input-dir data/images/test --output-dir outputs/

Outputs include visualized detections and optional JSON with bounding boxes and scores.

Evaluation
- Evaluation script: evaluate.py
- Supports typical detection metrics (mAP, precision, recall) depending on annotation format.
- Example:
  python evaluate.py --weights runs/exp/best.pt --annotations data/annotations/val_annotations.json
