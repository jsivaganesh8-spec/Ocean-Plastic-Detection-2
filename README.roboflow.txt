The dataset includes 1289 images.
Plastics-waste are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random exposure adjustment of between -28 and +28 percent

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
